# Assignment 2: Matching

In this assignment, you will implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm for monogamous matching. 

This assignment will be implemented in **Python** and all your code will be in the `match.py` file, specifically the `run_matching` function.

There are further instructions in the function docstring. Please pay careful attention to these.

## A Primer/Review of Gale-Shapley

If you weren't able to make it to the last comp meeting, or if you simply want a refresher of Gale-Shapley, be sure to check out the `Gale_Shapley_Matching.pdf` document.

The core algorithm is outlined in Section 3 of the document, though it's worth looking at the rest of the sections for a deeper understanding of Gale-Shapley. 

The material can be a bit difficult to wrestle with on a first pass, so definitely reach out to us (Iris and Iñaki) with questions!  

## Due Date & Logistics
This assignment is due on **Saturday, November 11th at 11:59 PM EST**. We recommend forking this repository and then sending either one of us (Iris or Iñaki) the link when you're ready. When you fork, make sure to set this repository as the upstream repository so you can pull any changes we make.

## Running Your Code
```python3 match.py```

Please verify that the matching your produced is indeed stable.

## Collaboration
In a nutshell: discussing theory with others is good; copying code directly is bad. We trust you to collaborate reasonably intelligently.  

## Other
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to directly reach out to us on Slack!
